# EASY QUIZ

This project is a simple quiz application built with React and Vite. It includes three main components: a greeting screen, a multiple-choice quiz, and a results page. Users can answer randomized questions and receive feedback on their performance. The project utilizes React's state management and Vite for fast development with hot module replacement (HMR).
